#### Technical Highlights:
* Implemented a time-based gameplay mechanic, where players have only three seconds to live, encouraging quick thinking and reflexes.
* Based on [NavMeshPlus](https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus) to enable enemy AI behaviour on tilemaps, allowing enemies to intelligently chase or retreat from the player.
* Free-roaming AI algorithm to manage enemy positioning and prevent overcrowding and enhance gameplay balance.
* Particle systems for VFX, including dynamic death animations and realistic smokes for fireballs.
* Use Unity's URP 2D lighting to create an atmospheric experience, employing darkness and limited lighting strategically to heighten suspense and challenge.
